This repsoitory is the new and improved version of my SkalarlyDeploy respository. Here I follow the capabilities and standards of Angular 17 and will continue to transfer/modify code from my old repository to this one. 
This repository is far cleaner then the last. As I make sure to organize and structure according to Angulars coding style guide. As well as implement standalone components, lazy loading, mobile first design,
and follow clean rules enforced by eslint plugins.

Soon I will deploy through GitHub so others can have a visual of where the project is at. 

I continue to work on this repsoitory daily and will be deploying it through Heroku at www.skalaraly.com
Future additions include:
  All capabilites of prior repository "without errors", with the addition of more PWA capabilities, socket.IO group chats...
  Cypress, Docker-Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, MongoDB, Jasmin, Jenkins,NgRx, and finally Ionic
